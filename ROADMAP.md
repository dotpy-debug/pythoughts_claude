## 📝 Decision Log

### **ADR-001: JAMstack over Traditional CMS**
**Decision:** Adopt Next.js SSG/ISR instead of WordPress/Ghost
**Rationale:** Better performance, developer experience, scalability
**Trade-offs:** Initial setup complexity, learning curve

### **ADR-002: Yjs over Operational Transform**
**Decision:** Use Yjs CRDT for collaboration
**Rationale:** Better offline support, simpler conflict resolution
**Trade-offs:** Larger bundle size, newer technology

### **ADR-003: Cloudinary over Self-hosted**
**Decision:** Use Cloudinary for media pipeline
**Rationale:** AI features, global CDN, transformations
**Trade-offs:** Cost at scale, vendor lock-in

### **ADR-004: AWS over Google Cloud**
**Decision:** AWS Rekognition/Comprehend for AI
**Rationale:** Better enterprise support, wider adoption
**Trade-offs:** Higher costs, complexity

## 🚨 Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| WebSocket scaling issues | High | High | Redis pub/sub, horizontal scaling |
| Collaboration conflicts | High | Medium | CRDT guarantees, conflict UI |
| AI false positives | High | Medium | Human review queue, appeal process |
| Git storage limits | Medium | Low | Compression, lazy loading, pruning |
| CDN costs | Medium | Low | Free tier optimization, caching |
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Low | Regular audits, CSP/SRI, pen testing |
