**High Priority (Should Fix Before Launch):**
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Hardening:**
   - Environment variables exposed with VITE_ prefix (client-side visible)
   - Need server-side only Redis URL and secrets management
   - Priority: P1 - Fix within 2 weeks

5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitoring and Observability:**

   - Priority: P1 - Expand before launch

**Medium Priority (Can Launch Without, But Plan to Fix):**
7. üìä **Performance Optimization:**
   - Bundle size analysis needed
   - Lazy loading optimization
   - Image optimization strategy
   - Priority: P2 - Post-launch iteration

8. üìä **Accessibility Audit:**
   - No WCAG compliance testing performed
   - Screen reader testing needed
   - Priority: P2 - Important for inclusivity

9. üìä **Documentation:**
   - API documentation incomplete
   - User guides missing
