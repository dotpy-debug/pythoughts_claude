## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

**Risk 1: UAT Testers Hard to Recruit**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Start recruitment early, offer incentives (early access, swag)
- **Contingency**: Use team members and friends/family as backup testers

**Risk 2: Critical Bug Discovered Late in Testing**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Start testing early, prioritize critical paths first
- **Contingency**: Delay launch if P0 bug found, fix immediately

**Risk 3: Performance Issues Under Load**
- **Likelihood**: Low (Phase 3 optimizations complete)
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Load testing in staging environment, scale infrastructure
- **Contingency**: Implement caching, optimize queries, scale servers

**Risk 4: Accessibility Violations Cannot Be Fixed Quickly**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Start accessibility testing early, use automated tools
- **Contingency**: Prioritize critical violations (WCAG A), defer non-critical
